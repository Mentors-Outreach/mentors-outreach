Welcome to Mentors Outreach! Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at bakari@mentorsoutreach.org.

These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Mentors Outreach, Inc. (“Mentors Outreach,” “we” and “us”). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy

# NOTICE: Please read these Terms carefully.

## Will these Terms ever change?

We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the mentorsoutreach.org website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them. Unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

## What about my privacy?

Mentors Outreach takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current Mentors Outreach Privacy Policy, please [click here.](https://mentorsoutreach.org/privacy-policy/)

## Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?

Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it.

The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Mentors Outreach. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Mentors Outreach is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.

You agree that Mentors Outreach shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.

## Will Mentors Outreach ever change the Services?

We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.

### What if I want to stop using the Services?

You’re free to do that at any time through your account settings; please refer to our Privacy Policy as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.

Mentors Outreach is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. Mentors Outreach has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.

Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.

Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.
