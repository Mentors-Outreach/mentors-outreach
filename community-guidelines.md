At Mentors Outreach, we want to foster a diverse and transparent space that gives an equitable voice to every member of our community. In order to do this, we need to create an online space where every member can feel welcome

While we are a self-moderating community, we also have clear values that we want to uphold. Here are some common-sense guidelines that’ll help you steer away from trouble and will help us create a healthy community. Please refer to these guidelines when writing and flagging posts.

As a member of Mentors Outreach, we want you to get immediate value from being here. That’s why we’re aiming to offer 4 simple things:

*   Meet people who share your interests, who do the same things, or who care about the same topics.

*   Share stories, experiences, and ideas.

*   Find a little inspiration, thought-provoking conversations, and expert perspective each and every day.

*   Follow others who inspire you to automatically receive notifications when they share.

## Before Starting your Adventure

Introduce Yourself. If you haven’t already. It should take you less than a minute and you’ll immediately start to see folks like you in the community feed.

Explore Topics & Groups. It might take you a minute to find your way around the Community, but you can view all articles according to their categories [**Topics**](https://social.mentorsoutreach.org/topics) & [**Groups**.](https://social.mentorsoutreach.org/groups)

### General Guidelines:-

We ask for everyone to lead with a "**Community first**" mindset. Meaning, We need your help to keep Mentors Outreach as valuable, authentic, and safe as possible.

*   **Be supportive**. Encourage and support your fellow members.

*   Everything said on Mentors Outreach should be treated as off the record. Don't share any conversations from Mentors Outreach with anyone outside who is not a member.

*   **Share generously**. Your stories and experiences may be exactly what another member needs to hear today to solve a problem or seize an opportunity.

*   **Be constructive**. We’re here to push each other forward and lift each other up. Find ways to help each other think bigger, reframe challenges, and stay curious.

*   **Don’t spam, promote, or troll**. This community exists to help you learn. It’s not a place to spam, promote your services, or to make insensitive remarks. Spamming discourages potential customers and dilutes credibility.

*   Please treat the information on member profiles with respect; do not scrape member information (manually or with scripts), and do not send promotional materials to members.

*   Mentors Outreach is not intended for self-promotion or personal brand building. It's ok to contribute articles you've written or offer your services, so long as your primary goal is to be helpful to others and add value to the community.

If you witness or are subject to any of the above unacceptable behaviors, we ask that you report it immediately and flag the content as unacceptable. You can report unwanted behavior via our [contact page](https://mentorsoutreach.org/contact)

Mentors Outreach reserves the right to remove any individual or topics, at any time, that’s identified as violating Rules.

### Topic Relevance

Content should be posted in relevant channels/Space/Group. Any post that is not in the appropriate channel can be flagged.

If you see any content that violates what we stand for, please flag it for removal. Users who do not uphold our guidelines will be temporarily restricted and repeat offenders will be permanently banned from using our service. Each of you are an important member of the community and you help shape the conversations on Mentors Outreach. The words you write and the actions you take matter.

#### Engagement Best Practices:-

*   Post clear, valuable, honest information.

*   Provide context in your post so others can contribute more effectively.

*   Use good grammar and check your spelling.

*   Make your comments useful and informative.

*   Provide examples in your solutions, either as links or a general scenario. This helps provide more insight into how to resolve the issue by having a tangible example.
