Contrary to popular opinion, Duku Fore believes that spontaneous decisions are sometimes the best decisions anyone can make. Personal growth is associated with meticulous planning and informed decisions, however, this is not always true. Duku explains how one spontaneous decision of his, to go to the USA to eat a sandwich, ended up with him being an ambassador in the United Nations.
