[Porter Gale's Funnel Test](http://blog.creativelive.com/porter-gale-the-funnel-test/) is based on the premise that, in order to expand your network in the right ways, you need to be clear on your purpose.  

#### Articulate your passions&#xA;Start by taking a few minutes to articulate your top 3 passions. To get started, consider:&#xA;&#xA;Some examples are: art, children, photography, architecture, kayaking, traveling, and inventing.

*   What do you enjoy doing?

*   How do you spend your free time?

*   If you had more time, how would you spend it?

## Connect with people with shared passions&#xA;For each passion, list two activities that will help you improve your skills in that area. For example, if you enjoy dancing, you might write “take a Salsa class once a month.” Commit to these activities. &#xA;&#xA;The better and more involved you are with your passions, the easier it is to connect with others who share them.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;With your main passions in mind, establish your tone. This should be a combination of your authentic self and how you’d like others to perceive you. Examples of tone include generous, honest, rigorous, caring, confident, and competitive.&#xA;&#xA;Now that you have chosen one or two words to describe yourself, write a twenty-word purpose. This will help you focus your actions. To spark your thinking, ask yourself what you really want to accomplish.
